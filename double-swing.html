    <h2>Setup and Starting Position</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose a kettlebell:</strong> Start with a moderate weight that you can control but that also challenges you.</li>
        <li><strong>Feet placement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.</li>
                <li>Point your toes out slightly (10-15 degrees).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Position the kettlebell:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the kettlebell on the ground about 30 cm (12 inches) in front of you.</li>
                <li>Handle should be angled toward you.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Hinge and Grip</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hinge at the hips (not a squat):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Push your hips back while keeping a soft bend in your knees.</li>
                <li>Your back should stay flat, chest open, and core engaged (think of bracing like you're about to take a punch).</li>
                <li>Weight should be evenly distributed on your midfoot and heels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Grip the kettlebell handle with both hands:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Hands should form a firm but relaxed grip, with thumbs wrapping around the handle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pack your shoulders by engaging the lats:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Squeeze your armpits as if holding a towel or tennis ball under each arm to activate your lats.</li>
                <li>Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears to maintain stability and control throughout the swing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Initiating the Swing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Set up the hike:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Slightly pull the kettlebell back toward you as you sink your hips further back.</li>
                <li>This pre-tension will help you generate momentum for the swing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hike the kettlebell:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pull the kettlebell back between your legs like you're hiking a football.</li>
                <li>Keep the kettlebell high in the groin area (close to your body) with your arms relaxed.</li>
                <li>Maintain tension in your lats to control the kettlebell's path.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Swing Motion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Explode with your hips:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Snap your hips forward by driving through your heels and extending your hips forcefully.</li>
                <li>Your core should stay tight to prevent overextending your lower back.</li>
                <li>Your glutes should fully contract at the top of the movement (imagine squeezing a coin between your cheeks).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Arms and kettlebell path:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the momentum generated by your hips to drive the kettlebell forward and up to about chest height.</li>
                <li>Keep your arms straight but relaxed (they should act as "ropes" with your hands holding the kettlebell).</li>
                <li>The kettlebell should feel weightless at the top of the swing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Maintain shoulder packing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue squeezing your armpits and engaging your lats to keep the shoulders packed.</li>
                <li>This ensures stability and prevents the kettlebell from pulling you forward.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Top Position</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Body alignment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>At the top of the swing, your body should form a straight line (hips, shoulders, knees, and ankles aligned).</li>
                <li>Avoid leaning backward (no hyperextension of the spine).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Breathing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Exhale sharply at the top of the swing (like a quick "hiss" or forceful breath).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Return (Descent Phase)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guide the kettlebell down:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the kettlebell to fall naturally, maintaining control.</li>
                <li>Keep your arms relaxed but guide the kettlebell back toward your groin.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hinge at the hips again:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Push your hips back immediately to absorb the kettlebellâ€™s momentum.</li>
                <li>Keep the kettlebell high between your legs, maintaining tension in your hamstrings, core, and lats.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Repeat for Reps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flow with rhythm:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue the hip-hinging and snapping pattern for each swing.</li>
                <li>Focus on a smooth, controlled rhythm rather than muscling the movement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Squatting instead of hinging:</strong> Your knees should not bend too much; most of the movement comes from your hips.</li>
        <li><strong>Overextending the back:</strong> Avoid arching your lower back at the top of the swing.</li>
        <li><strong>Using your arms to lift:</strong> Your hips, not your arms, should drive the kettlebell forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Letting the kettlebell drop too low:</strong> Keep the kettlebell high between your legs to maintain control and reduce strain on your lower back.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Breathing Pattern</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inhale:</strong> During the downward phase as you hinge your hips.</li>
        <li><strong>Exhale:</strong> Forcefully at the top of the swing.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Master the hinge:</strong> Practicing hip hinges without weight can help reinforce proper form.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a mirror:</strong> If available, check your alignment to ensure you're not overextending or collapsing your posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Record yourself:</strong> Watching a video of your form can reveal subtle mistakes you may not feel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This process ensures efficient movement, optimal power generation, and protection of your lower back. Once you've got this technique down, you'll build both strength and endurance while improving your core stability!</p>
